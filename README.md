# Realtime-FaceExpression-Recognition
This project proposes a real-time face expression detection system using 
OpenCV and Haar Cascade Classifier. The system detects faces, extracts 
features, and recognizes expressions using a pre-trained deep learning model. 
It visualizes expressions in real-time and is suitable for emotion detection, 
human-computer interaction, and surveillance. The system is efficient and 
effective, with potential to improve accuracy and performance by incorporating 
advanced deep learning models
